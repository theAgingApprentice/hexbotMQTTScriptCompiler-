/ compiler script to walk with a 4 legged gait
/ -documentation in gait4.pdf soon

/set up in first position
MoveToHomePosition
/ pause command isn't implemented yet, so just repeat the command
MoveToHomePosition
MoveToHomePosition

/ move legs 2 and 5 out of the way, into gull wing position
/ MoveRelLastLocal moves specified leg by offsets in local coords from wherever it currently is.
/ we're in home position, and first command works on leg 2
/ the 4 says go +4 in local X direction, i.e. sideways away from bot for leg 2
/ the 11 say go +11 in local Y direction, i.e. raise the 11 cm
/ the 0 says don't change the Z direction, i.e. don't pivot the hip
MoveRelLastLocal 2,4,11,0
MoveRelLastLocal 5,4,11,0
Doit 1000,25

/ move leg 1 to spot A
/ MoveRelLastGlobal moves specified leg by offsets in global coords from wherever it currently is.
/ we're in home position, and these commands work on leg 1
/ the first 6 says move 6 cm in the global X direction, i.e. towards front of bot
/ the 0 says don't change the Y position - how far you are sideways from the centerline of the bot
/ the last 6 says go 6 CM in the global Z direction, i.e. upwards
/ this command moves toe diagonally, going forward and up at the same time
MoveRelLastglobal 1,6,0,6
/ the template.txt file controls the frame time interval (25 ish for smooth leg movement)
/    and the debugging level ( 1 for no console output to slow down leg movement & make it jaggy)
/ output a flow command to do the movement we described above
Doit 1000

/ do a similar command to lower the leg left in the air after last command, straight down
MoveRelLastGlobal 1,0,0,-6
Doit 1000

/ move leg 4 to spot B - similar process, but a different relative offset
MoveRelLastGlobal 4,2,0,6
Doit 1000,25
MoveRelLastGlobal 4,0,0,-6
Doit 1000

/ move leg 3 to spot C - similar process, but a different relative offset
MoveRelLastGlobal 3,-2,0,6
Doit 1000,25
MoveRelLastGlobal 3,0,0,-6
Doit 1000

/ move leg6 to spot D - similar process, but a different relative offset
MoveRelLastGlobal 6,-6,0,6
Doit 1000,25
MoveRelLastGlobal 6,0,0,-6
Doit 1000

/ OK, legs are positioned. ready to do the actual 4 legged walking

/ to be continued...
