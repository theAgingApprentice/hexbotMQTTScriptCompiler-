/ compiler script to walk with a alternating 3 legged gait


/set up in first position
MoveToHomePosition
/ pause command isn't implemented yet, so just repeat the command
MoveToHomePosition

/ push legs down and in to center a bit to maximize stability
MoveRelLastLocal A,-2,-4,0

/Position legs for start of 2 step gait

/ move odd legs 1 to spot A
/ MoveRelLastGlobal moves specified leg by offsets in global coords from wherever it currently is.

/ move legs 1, 3 and 5 up and forward
MoveRelLastglobal o,2,0,4
Doit $p

/ and then straight down
MoveRelLastglobal o,0,0,-4
Doit $p

/ similarly, move even legs up and back to spot B
MoveRelLastglobal e,-2,0,4
Doit $p

/ and then straight down
MoveRelLastglobal e,0,0,-4
Doit $p

/ once we gte the step debugged, we can do it repeatedly with a cycle
/ Cyclestart 8

/ ==================== tme to take a step/
/push the odd legs back half a step
MoveRelLastGlobal o,-2,0,0
/and raise the even legs from spot B 
MoveRelLastGlobal e,4,0,4
Doit $w

/and push odds back a bit more, and put evens onto floor at start of their step
MoveRelLastGlobal o,-2,0,0
/ and drop down the evens 
MoveRelLastGlobal e,0,0,-4
Doit $w

/ ============== and now a step with the other 3 legs
/push the even legs back half a step
MoveRelLastGlobal e,-2,0,0
/and raise the odd legs from spot B 
MoveRelLastGlobal e,4,0,4
Doit $w

/and push evens back a bit more, and put odds onto floor at start of their step
MoveRelLastGlobal e,-2,0,0
/ and drop down the evens 
MoveRelLastGlobal o,0,0,-4
Doit $w

/ ====== this would be the end of the cycle ====

/ CycleEnd 8
